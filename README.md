<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DiScholEd/nachlassprojekt/main/boeckh.png" title="August Boeckh" width="200"> 

**Description**: This collection can be considered a catalogue of manuscripts written, or contributed to, by August Boeckh (1785â€“1867).

**Content**: This collection contains a [corpus](https://github.com/DiScholEd/nachlassprojekt/tree/main/corpus) of texts (915 as of now). There is no folder for the indexes that gives extra information about the places, persons, organizations and works/books mentioned in the documents, because they are the same as the ones from the Berlin Intellectuals collection (see [here](https://github.com/DiScholEd/berlin-intellectuals/tree/main/indexes)).  
There is also an an [XML file](https://github.com/DiScholEd/nachlassprojekt/blob/main/timeline_nachlassprojekt.xml), referencing the date of each document from the corpus, to create a timeline of the collection. 

**Website**: This collection can be seen displayed in the publication platform of this organization [here](https://discholed.huma-num.fr/exist/apps/discholed/index.html?collection=nachlassprojekt).
